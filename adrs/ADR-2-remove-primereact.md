## Decision:

Remove [PrimeReact](https://primereact.org/) usage, replace with custom controls

## Why?

* Easier to maintain (no need to update PrimeReact)
* Easier to style / less styling opinions from PrimeReact
* Less complicated as my use cases are simple
* Gain more experience making custom inputs

Overall I've enjoyed using PrimeReact and don't really have any issues with it, but for the reasons above I feel it's appropriate to remove this dependency
